This is my official Github account for educational purposes.  My goal with this account is to gain a better understanding of Github to start creating software projects.  
This repository will have lots of information that will be a great learning tool for new beginners like myself!  The information will include programming fundamentals, source control systems, simple web pages, simple databases and much more!
